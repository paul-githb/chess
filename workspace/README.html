		<h1>AP Computer Science A (Best) Final Project (Ever)</h1>

			<strong>
				Project Name:
			</strong>
			Chess

				Achievements:
			</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Data Structures:
					</strong>
					This project demonstrates use of data structures by representing the chess board
					as a two-dimensional, 8x8 array of tiles containing pieces, as well as using two
					ArrayLists of Pieces to store all captured pieces.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Inheritance:
					</strong>
					This project demonstrates inheritance as the Piece class takes the role of the
					parent class, with all other piece types deriving from this one class: Pawn,
					Rook, Knight, Bishop, King, and Queen.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Sorting:
					</strong>
					This project demonstrates the use of sorting in the form of insertion sort. This
					sorting algorithm was put to use in the sorting of the sets of captured pieces,
					which was defined and maintained in the Player class. The pieces were sorted by
					their piece value, with the King in the front with a piece value of 0 (useful
					in determining whether or not a winner was found) and the Knights in front of the
					Bishops.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Abstraction:
					</strong>
					This project demonstrates abstraction through the use of declaring abstract methods
					inside the Piece class, which had to be defined in each individual derived class.
					These two methods are:
					<i>
						boolean moveIsValid(int, int, Board),
					</i>
					which took two integer values and determined whether or not moving the piece to that
					position on the board was valid (disregarding checks, only for validity), and
					<i>
						String getStringValue(),
					</i>
					which simply returned the String representation of the piece for use in the text-based
					game. (This was not entirely needed, but good for "demonstrating complexity.")
				</li>
			</ol>

				Some notable features of our project include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Promotion:
					</strong>
					This is a chess rule which states that if a pawn makes it to the other end of the board,
					then it must be replaced immediately with one of the following: a queen, knight, rook, or
					bishop. When a pawn satisfies this rule, a popup message appears in which the player who
					owns the pawn chooses which piece to replace the pawn with via a drop down menu. Play
					continues as normal with the opposing player's turn, unless there is a checkmate.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Castling:
					</strong>
					This is a special move in Chess in which the King advances two squares toward any given
					rook belonging to the same player, and that rook is placed on the opposite side of the King.
					This move is valid as long as the following conditions hold:
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The rook has not been moved.
						</li>
						<li>
							The king has not been moved.
						</li>
						<li>
							There exists no piece in between the king and the rook.
						</li>
						<li>
							The move will not put the king under a check.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					The way our game handles this move is by performing it only when the appropriate CastleButton
					is pressed. There exists four CastleButtons in the frame, and they are only visible when a
					castle is available (i.e. the above conditions hold). The accessibility of one button does not
					depend on that of the other buttons.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Light Indicator:
					</strong>
					Each player has a little light indicator saying whether or not it's the player's turn. This
					makes it easy to determine whose turn it is without having to display text on the screen.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Checks:
					</strong>
					A rule that's integrated in most special rules or moves in Chess is called the check. If a
					player is under check, then his or her King piece is currently being threatened. If the
					player under check does not respond appropriately to counter the check, then the player's
					move is not valid. I.e. the player <i>must</i> attempt to counter the check in order to
					have a valid move. Possible methods of countering a check include:
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Moving the King to a tile which does not put it under check.
						</li>
						<li>
							Capturing the piece which is currently threatening the King.
						</li>
						<li>
							Blocking the check using one of the player's own pieces.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					If the player is unable to respond to the check in any way, then the player is under a
					checkmate. This means that the opposing player has won the game.
			</ul>

				Improvements:
			</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>I think we're done! Just be sure to get familiar with the code and how everything works.</li>
